## PROBLEM STATEMENT ##

You are climbing a staircase with n + 1 steps, numbered from 0 to n.
You are also given a 1-indexed integer array costs of length n, where costs[i] is the cost of step i.
From step i, you can jump only to step i + 1, i + 2, or i + 3. The cost of jumping from step i to step j is defined as: costs[j] + (j - i)2
You start from step 0 with cost = 0.
Return the minimum total cost to reach step n.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, costs = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 13
Explanation:
One optimal path is 0 → 1 → 2 → 4
Jump	Cost Calculation	Cost
0 → 1	costs[1] + (1 - 0)2 = 1 + 1	2
1 → 2	costs[2] + (2 - 1)2 = 2 + 1	3
2 → 4	costs[4] + (4 - 2)2 = 4 + 4	8
Thus, the minimum total cost is 2 + 3 + 8 = 13
Example 2:
Input: n = 4, costs = [5,1,6,2]
Output: 11
Explanation:
One optimal path is 0 → 2 → 4
Jump	Cost Calculation	Cost
0 → 2	costs[2] + (2 - 0)2 = 1 + 4	5
2 → 4	costs[4] + (4 - 2)2 = 2 + 4	6
Thus, the minimum total cost is 5 + 6 = 11
Example 3:
Input: n = 3, costs = [9,8,3]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The optimal path is 0 → 3 with total cost = costs[3] + (3 - 0)2 = 3 + 9 = 12
Constraints:
1 <= n == costs.length <= 105​​​​​​​
1 <= costs[i] <= 104

## SOLUTION ##

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int, costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [-1] * (n + 1)
        def solve(i: int) -> int:
            if i > n:
                return float('inf')
            if i == n:
                return 0
            if dp[i] != -1:
                return dp[i]
            oneStep = (costs[i] + 1) + solve(i + 1)
            twoStep = (costs[i + 1] + 4 + solve(i + 2)) if i + 2 <= n else float('inf')
            threeStep = (costs[i + 2] + 9 + solve(i + 3)) if i + 3 <= n else float('inf')
            dp[i] = min(oneStep, twoStep, threeStep)
            return dp[i]
        return solve(0)
